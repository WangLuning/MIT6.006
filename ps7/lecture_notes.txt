DP:recurisve + memoization + guess all
there is no straightforward approach or enumeration, have to guess all possible ways

build the bottom up solution

same meaning:
DP subproblems
topological sort of subproblems in DAG

acyclic == topological sort == recursion

subgraph dependency:
has to be acyclic (like DFS has to record visited cells to avoid loops)
record state: knowing about past assignments

subproblems of strings/sequences:
suffix x[i:]
prefix x[:i]
substrings x[i:j]
